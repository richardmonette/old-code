			<h5>Low Discrepancy Samplers</h5>
			
			<p>When using random sampling, a large number of samples can be required before a uniform distribution over the sample space is achieved. As a result, a relatively 
			large number of samples are required to reduce noise when using random sampling. A more efficient strategy is to use low discrepancy sampling sequences which 
			ensure a good distribution of samples over the sample space. One of the simplest such sequences is the van der Corput sequence which is a low discrepancy sequence
			over a single dimension. Intalgio uses two dimensional Halton (a higher dimensional generalization of the van der Corput sequence) and the 
			Hammersely sequences when sampling. The Hammersely sequence is used in most situations such as sampling luminaries. The Halton sequence is used specifically 
			for generating photon emission directs as it is capable of generating samples even when the total number of required samples is unknown initially.</p>

			<h3>Intaglio Photon Mapping Renderer</h3>
			
			<p>As part of a directed study project which I started in May 2010 I have been working developing my own rendering system
			primarily based around the photon mapping algorithm presented by Henrik Wann Jensen in his book <a href="http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik/papers/book/">Realistic 
			Image Synthesis using Photon Mapping</a>.<p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>Although I had previously worked with <a href="raytracing.html">path tracing approaches</a> to solving the rendering equation, I decided to implement a photon
			mapping based rendering system because the algorithm allows for faster rendering while still being able to handle complex lighting interactions like caustics, 
			global illumination and arbitrary BRDFs.<p> 
			
			<br>
			
			<p>The name Intalgio refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intaglio_(printmaking)">printing process</a> often used for high end documents such as passports and currency. Some of Intalgio's features
			include:</p>

			<h5>Multi-threaded Network Rendering</h5>
			
			<p>One systems where multiple cores and/or processors are available, Intaglio will render in a fully multi-threaded configuration. Thread workload is handled by a
			central work manager which assigns render regions to each thread in order to keep threads running efficiently and evenly. The workload manager can also handle 
			sending render regions out to slave machines over a local area network making it possible to leverage multiple machines on a single render job.</p>
			
			<h5>Irradiance Caching</h5>
			
			<p>A so-called Final Gathering pass is normally used to reduce the low frequency noise that is otherwise characteristic of a direct visualization of the 
			global photon map. The Final Gathering step consists of integrating a hemisphere over a given surface point and gathering the incident irradiance. This extra
			level of indirection reduces noise. However, this Final Gathering step can be computationally intensive resulting in much longer rendering times. In order
			to keep render times practical, Intaglio uses the Irradiance Caching algorithm which was first introduced by Greg Ward in the paper 
			<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=378490">A ray tracing solution for diffuse interreflection</a>. Irradiance caching works by storing pre-computed 
			irradiance values and then interpolating those values, usually according to distance, relative similarity of normals and position. Two passes can 
			be used in order to ensure that pixels rendered in scanline order are coherent in terms of the cache values available. Intaglio uses an octree
			data structure in order to accelerating searching for these points later during rendering.</p>
